# 🔍 Debug Instructions for Audio Recognition Issue

## 🧪 How to Debug:

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
2. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try the app and look for these messages:
   - `🎤 Transcription result: "whatever you said"`
   - `🧠 Checking answer: "what_was_heard" vs current car: "Toyota"`
   - `🧠 Similarity score: 0.XX`

### 2. **Check Server Logs**
Look at the terminal where Flask is running for:
- `🎤 OpenAI Transcription received: 'what_openai_heard'`
- `Fallback transcription (API failed): random_name`

### 3. **Try This Quick Test**

Run this command to test with perfect transcription:
```bash
# Stop current app
Ctrl+C

# Start with test mode to see if matching logic works
TEST_MODE=true python3 app.py
```

Then test - it should work perfectly with mock data.

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Fixes:**

### **Issue 1: Audio Format Problems**
If you see lots of API errors, the browser might be sending bad audio format.

**Fix:** Use test mode temporarily
```bash
TEST_MODE=true python3 app.py
```

### **Issue 2: Car Names Don't Match**
If transcription works but names don't match, we need to update the brand aliases.

**Example:**
- You say: "Toyota" 
- OpenAI hears: "toyota motor"
- App expects: "toyota"
- **Result**: No match

**Fix:** We'll update the matching logic based on what you see in the logs.

### **Issue 3: Similarity Threshold Too High**
If similarity score is like 0.6 but threshold is 0.7, it won't match.

**Fix:** Lower the threshold or improve aliases.

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. Try the app and check both browser console and server logs
2. Tell me what you see in the transcription results
3. I'll adjust the matching logic based on real data

**Tip:** If nothing is working, run with `TEST_MODE=true` first to confirm the app logic is working, then we'll fix the audio recognition.
